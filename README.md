# spy: a Python CLI

`spy` stands for “<b>s</b>tream <b>py</b>thon”. It's a CLI for python that chains
fragments of code together.

**spy is unreleased software**. You can install it if you want, but please
don't expect reliability or stability—I'll make a release when I have those
things.

spy is compatible with Python 3.2 and newer, and is currently tested on
CPython 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, and PyPy3 2.3.1. It is not compatible with Python 2.

**The docs, including introduction, are
[on ReadTheDocs](https://spy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).**
